# Usage
This guide is intended for people who have not used datapacks/other plugins to incorporate additional recipes into Minecraft. Even if you have it may still be useful to follow this guide, as this plugin doesn't work the same way as others do. If you are new to using yml files. I would highly suggest seeking out the [How To Use a YML Page](./how-to-use-a-yml) on this Wiki.
