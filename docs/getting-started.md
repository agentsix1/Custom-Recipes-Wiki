# Usage
This guide is intended for people who have not used datapacks/other plugins to incorporate additional recipes into Minecraft. Even if you have it may still be useful to follow this guide, as this plugin doesn't work the same way as others do. If you are new to using yml files. I would highly suggest seeking out the [How To Use a YML](../how-to-use-a-yml) section on this Wiki.

# Getting Started
<font color="red" style="font-style: italic">If you have not yet installed this plugin on your server. Please follow the <a href="../install-guide">Installation Guide</a>.</font>

## Creating/Removing Recipes
Information regarding the adding or removing of recipes can be found in the [Configuration](../configuration) section of this wiki.
All changes to the recipes require a reload *(not recommended)* or a server restart. New recipes will not be added or removed in any other way

## Commands Usage
As of the release of v0.1, no commands are associated with this plugin. I do have plans to change this in the [future](../ideas).

## What Recipes Come By Default?
I would highly suggest checking out the [Recipes](../recipes) section on this Wiki. I have posted all of the [recipes](../recipes) that this plugin has by default.

*Note: The default recipes can be removed or modified with ease by simply modifying the yml files found in the plugin folder!*

## Have Questions or Issues?
If you have any further questions or issues that are not answered within this Wiki. I would suggest going over to the [Issues](https://github.com/agentsix1/Custom-Recipes/issues) section of our [GitHub](https://github.com/agentsix1/Custom-Recipes) and creating an [Issue](https://github.com/agentsix1/Custom-Recipes/issues). I hope to get back to you in a timely manner.

*Note: This does require you to have a GitHub account. It's fairly straightforward to create a GitHub account.*
